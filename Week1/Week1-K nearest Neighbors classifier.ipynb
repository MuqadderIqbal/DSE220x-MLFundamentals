    "A simple KNN (where k=1). We use the MNIST dataset (60,000 training data points and 10,000 test data points) to label images of digits (0-9) with the proper digit they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### How do we even represent images? ####\n",
    "    Each image is represented as a 28x28 (=784) pixels vector. Each pixel is represented in gray scale: a value between 0 and 255. 0 means \"total absence\" or \"black\". 255 means \"total presence\" or \"white\". More on gray scale here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### What will be our approach? ####\n",
    "    We will find the ONE image (because k=1 here) from test set that most closely resembles the one in training set and predict the matching image's label as the predicted output. \n",
    "* #### How will we even calculate the \"closest\" matching image? ####\n",
    "    We will calculate the \"euclidean\" distance between two images to find the \"distance\" between them and use the one with the least distance value for predicting the output label. More about euclidean distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance. Generally, the euclidean distance between two points (x and y) is represented as ||x-y||.\n",
    "* #### How will we establish the accuracy of such an algorithm?####\n",
    "    Since the one nearest neighbor of an obesrvation in the \"training\" set is itself, the error rate of training dataset will be zero and hence not a good indicator of the accuracy. We,instead, use another dataset called the \"test\" set and calculate the fraction of test points that were incorrectly classified. That's called Test Error.\n",
    "* #### How can we improve the accuracy of such an algorithm?####\n",
    "    Two options: either choose a better value for \"k\" or find a better distance function.\n",
    "* #### In real world problems, we don't have any separate test data set. How can we find a value of \"k\" in such cases?####\n",
    "    We use the concept of \"cross validation\". A n-fold cross validation technique divides the trainint set into n equal subsets, reserves one set as test set and uses the rest as training sets. This is done as many times and the test error is the average of all test errors. Repeat the same process by also varying the value of k (nearest neighbors) and pick the one that results in the least error.\n",
    "* #### How can we use a better distance function to improve our algorithm?\n",
    "    In case of images, Euclidean distance is not a good distance function. For example: if the same image is moved slight to right, the Euclidean distance for them will be different. A better approach is to use \"tanget distance\" instead. An even better function (or family of functions) is something that's invarient to the transformations to the image. It's called \"shape context\".\n",
    "* #### Any other related problems to know about?\n",
    "    Yes, selecting the features that are good candidates for prediction. It's called \"feature selection\". Nosiy features can wreak havoc on your algorithm. Use domain knowledge to identify useful features for the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another problem to address will be the algorithmic complexity (performance) of the algorithm. Naive search (Nearest Neighbors) can be very slow on large data sets (especially images). Luckily, there are data structures (a part of standard Python libraries for Nearest Neighbors) like Locality Sensitive Hashing, Ball trees and K-d trees that help.\n",
